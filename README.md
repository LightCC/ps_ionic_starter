## LawChoice project

Install NPM and Node.JS.

Then install the appropriate npm packages to run ionic:

```bash
npm install -g @ionic/cli native-run cordova-res
```

Then have ionic setup a new project called `lawChoice`:

```bash
ionic start lawChoice blank --type=react --capacitor
```

To run the development web server and view the project, run `ionic serve` from the project directory.

```bash
cd lawChoice
ionic serve
```
